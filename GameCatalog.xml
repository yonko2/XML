            <description>Dance Dance Revolution is a music video game series produced by Konami.
        Introduced in Japan in 1998 as part of the Bemani series, and released in North America and

        well they time their dance to the patterns presented to them and are allowed to choose more
        music to play to if they receive a passing score.</description>
